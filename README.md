A repository for the implementation of algorithms in javascript. This tutorial is copied from [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/index.php). You can clone this repo to learn the fundamentals of Algorithms and data structures alongside me.  I know how scary `Data Structures & Algorithms` are for a self thought programmer. Trust me I am in the same shoes as you. I hope this small project helps someone understand algorithms and data structures. Happy learning

# ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES IN JAVASCRIPT

### *What is an algorithm?*
It is simply a step-by-step instruction to solve a given problem

### *What is a data structure?*
This is about how data is organised in different structures do that it can be used efficiently.
